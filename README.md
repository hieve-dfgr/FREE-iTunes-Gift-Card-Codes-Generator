Activity Screens: Teacher Pacing and Pause Class
Use this page to plan your use of Teacher Pacing and Pause Class. Teacher Pacing lets you restrict students to a single screen or a range of screens. Pause Class keeps students from interacting with whatever screens they are currently viewing. Use these two tools to create conversations in your classroom.
Consider these questions as you plan:

    Which screen(s) should everyone work on at the same time? Why?
    Which screen(s) do you want to keep students from seeing until you're ready for the class to see them together? (Perhaps because they reveal answers or require a whole class conversation for introduction.)
    Are there any points in the lesson where you will want to make sure students aren’t playing with the screens while you discuss something as a class?
